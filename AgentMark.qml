// One mark per agent, each the real one, drawn rather than shipped.
//
// The tool column used to be the letters C, O and X. Three capitals in a row at
// ten pixels is a puzzle rather than a signal: you have to read them, in order,
// and remember which letter stood for which tool, and X for Codex was a guess
// even after being told. A mark is recognised without being read.
//
// These are the products' own marks, not shapes that suggest them. The first
// attempt at this file invented three: a six-spoke asterisk, a rounded frame and
// a hexagon. They were legible and they were wrong, which is worse than letters
// -- a made-up mark in the place a real one belongs teaches the reader something
// false. The paths below come from lobehub/lobe-icons (MIT), each already
// normalised to a 24x24 box and a single even-odd path:
//
//   claude    the Anthropic burst                    clay    #D97757
//   opencode  the terminal frame and block            blue    #5C9CF5
//   codex     the blossom with > and _                green   #10A37F
//   pi        the stepped P with a square hole        mono    #C9C9C9
//   cursor    the hexagon outline                     mono    #8A8A8A
//
// The colours are each tool's own: Anthropic's clay is what Claude is drawn in
// wherever it appears, opencode's own TUI theme ships #5c9cf5, #10A37F is
// OpenAI's green. Identity is the one thing in this panel allowed not to follow
// the desktop theme, because a Claude mark that turned green under a green theme
// would be stating something untrue. Everything the panel says in its own voice
// still follows the theme.
//
// Pi and Cursor carry no such colour to borrow: pi.dev's own mark ships plain
// black and switches to white in dark mode, and Cursor's mark is a plain black
// and white cube with no chromatic brand colour at all. Both are monochrome by
// the product's own choice, not by an omission here -- the two neutrals below
// exist only to read as "on" and stay apart from each other on a dark panel,
// not to stand in for a colour neither product has.
//
// Vector rather than bitmap, for the reason the neighbouring plugin gives: a
// raster mark needs a recolour pass to take a state and is still one fixed size.
// A path takes `color` and `size` and costs neither. No icon font either --
// Nerd Fonts carries a glyph for none of these five.
