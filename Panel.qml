// Delegates get their own bound component context rather than the enclosing
// object's, which is what Qt 6.5 onwards recommends and what makes this file
// statically checkable: without it qmllint cannot see that the `root` a delegate
// names is this document's root, and reports all 274 of those as unqualified
// access -- 379 warnings that say nothing, drowning the ones that do.
//
// It is not free, and the cost is the point. Under Bound a delegate no longer
// inherits `modelData` and `index` from its context: it must declare them
// `required`, and one that does not silently draws nothing. qmllint names every
// such site, which is how the eleven below were found rather than reported.
pragma ComponentBehavior: Bound

// The panel: one grouped, searchable list of every skill, MCP server and Claude
// Code plugin the three agents load. bin/agent-skills does all the I/O and prints
// one line of JSON; this file reads it and draws it, and the only process it
// runs to read or change any of that is the helper, wrapped in a /bin/bash
// one-liner that caps the read and takes the whole job group down with it.
// wl-copy and xdg-open are the other two, and neither is handed anything but a
// string the user has just asked to have put somewhere.
//
// The helper registers four subcommands. `scan` and `doctor` only read.
// `category` and `describe note` write the two files this plugin owns,
// ~/.config/agent-skills/categories.json and descriptions.json, which record
// nothing but which shelf a skill was filed on, what that shelf is called, and
// the note somebody wrote about a skill for themselves. Nothing here ever opens
// a file for writing -- each of those two is a helper run with the change in
// argv -- so what a reviewer has to read to believe it is the helper's argument
// handling rather than the whole of this file.
//
// The claim that matters, stated at the width it is actually true: nothing
// outside those two files is written at any point. No SKILL.md is opened for
// writing, no agent's configuration file is touched, nothing is deleted or
// moved. Two earlier versions of this panel could rewrite the `description:`
// value of somebody else's SKILL.md and move a skill directory to the desktop
// trash; both are gone, because those are changes to what an agent loads on its
// next turn and no confirmation makes that the right shape for a bar widget
// somebody installs from a marketplace. Every row still says where its own state
// is written and what it currently is, because that state is theirs to change
// and this panel only reports it.

  // is reading the new text, which means it has to be in SKILL.md.
  //
  // The editor writes two independent things and they go to two different
  // places. `note` stores your own words about a skill in this plugin's own
  // file: no agent opens that file, so a note costs nothing and is never in any
  // figure this panel prints. `write` replaces the `description:` value in
  // somebody else's SKILL.md, keeping the author's own text so `reset` can put
  // it back -- and that one moves the figure, at the moment it is saved,
  // because the file now says something different.
  //
  // The whole of the file work is the helper's. It replaces one value in the
  // frontmatter and passes every other byte through, reads the file back
  // through the parser the panel and the agents will read it with, and puts the
  // original back if the read-back disagrees. None of that is repeated here.
  //
  // A list of runs rather than one, because a single Save can be both of them
  // and the helper is run one at a time. The second waits for the first to exit
